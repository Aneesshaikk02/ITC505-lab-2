    <!-- Introduction -->
    <article>
        <h1>Introduction to Data Sciences</h1>
        <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.</p>
        <p>It involves various stages such as data collection, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, ultimately leading to data-driven decision-making.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Data Collection -->
    <article>
        <h2>Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>Data collection involves gathering raw data from various sources, including databases, files, sensors, and web scraping.</p>
        <p>Preprocessing steps include cleaning data to remove errors and inconsistencies, transforming data into a usable format, and organizing data for analysis.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Exploratory Data Analysis -->
    <article>
        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>EDA involves examining and visualizing data to understand its underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships.</p>
        <p>Common EDA techniques include summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Statistical Modeling -->
    <article>
        <h2>Statistical Modeling</h2>
        <p>Statistical modeling encompasses the application of mathematical models to analyze and interpret data.</p>
        <p>Common statistical techniques include regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Machine Learning -->
    <article>
        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
        <p>Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are common types of machine learning approaches.</p>
    </article>

    <!-- Big Data Technologies -->
    <article>
        <h2>Big Data Technologies</h2>
