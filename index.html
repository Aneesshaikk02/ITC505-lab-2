        <h1>Cloud Computing: An Overview</h1>

        <p>Cloud computing is a paradigm that has revolutionized the way computing resources are accessed, delivered, and managed. It offers a flexible and scalable model for users to access applications, storage, and computing power over the internet. This paper explores the key concepts, advantages, and challenges associated with cloud computing.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

        <p>Cloud computing is characterized by several key concepts:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service:</strong> Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Network Access:</strong> Services are accessible over the network and can be accessed through various devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Pooling:</strong> Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned to scale out or in based on demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>

        <p>Cloud computing offers numerous advantages to individuals and businesses:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Users pay for the resources they use, leading to cost savings compared to traditional on-premise infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cloud services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, providing flexibility for users.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Cloud providers often offer high levels of reliability and redundancy, reducing the risk of data loss or service downtime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>

        <p>During the conversion of this research paper to HTML, I made deliberate choices to use appropriate HTML tags to structure the content. Headings were assigned using the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags to maintain a hierarchical structure. Lists were marked up using the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags for better readability.</p>

        <p>The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section includes a script to display the last modified date, providing transparency on when the page was last updated. This choice aims to enhance the user experience and maintain the integrity of information presented on the web page.</p>

        <footer>
            <p>Last updated: 
                <span id="lastModified"></span>
            </p>
        </footer>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var x = document.lastModified;
            document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
        </script>
